 
Week-V Milestone for Projects (Refer Project Plan) 
1. Create endpoints for each functionality 
Endpoints for all core functionalities have been created. 
• User Authentication (Login, Register, Logout) 
• File Upload & Retrieval 
• Data Processing / Business Logic Execution 
• Query / Search functionality 
• Admin Operations 
2. Implement business logic 
Core business logic has been implemented according to the use cases. 
• Input handling and processing are working as expected. 
• Core algorithms and workflows have been integrated with the endpoints. 
3. Handle input validation 
Input validation has been added to all endpoints. 
• Mandatory field checks 
• Type validation (string, number, file format) 
• Constraints (length, format, allowed values) 
• Error messages for invalid input 
4. Request parsing 
 Implemented request parsing for: 
• JSON requests 
• Form-data (for file uploads) 
• Query parameters in GET requests 
• Proper error handling on invalid/malformed requests 

5. Response formatting 
 Standardized response format has been set: 
• Success → { status: "success", data: {...}, message: "..." } 
• Error → { status: "error", message: "..." } 
• Consistent HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, 404, 500) 
 
Preprocessing 
 Preprocessing phase has been completed. 
• Collected raw data relevant to the research topic. 
• Cleaned and normalized the dataset (removed noise, handled missing values). 
• Applied tokenization / formatting as per requirements. 
• Data is now ready for feature extraction and analysis.
